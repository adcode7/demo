/*            <<<<<< how does js code execute and Hoistin >>>>>

JS is a synchronies and single thread language 

synchronies means: line by line  execute that code 


*when we write any code : execution context make in execution context 
1.)Memory allocation 
2.)code execution



temporal dead zone in (let or const ) it is in  TDZ when ever we can not assign the valtue of that variable
  


when i print any variable before initialization 
it gives us error i.e : variable is not initialize



when i print var variable before initialization 
then it give us "undefined"

why ?


Hoistin : (just a concept not implementation) js automatically move the deceleration of variable and function  part move to top of containing scope
during compilation phase
